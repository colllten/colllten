## Projects
### Traxpense (Java, MySQL Server)
    
   As a financially independent student, it is important that I keep track of my financial standing. I must always stay on top of bills and tuition, and ensure that I am not slipping into debt. In early Summer 2021, I dropped a notebook on my desk to start writing all of my expenses and the money I had made so far. I immediately thought, "I wish there was an app for this." I had tried iOS apps in the past, but they all require a subscription, or they are not tailored to my needs. Then I realized that I am computer science student, and I can solve my problem.
   
   I developed a program that tracks a user's expenses across the 12 months. Users can enter their profits and losses, which are divided into unique categories. It is connected to a MySQL database and supports multiple users. Traxpense is currently only tailored for my use, but I plan on changing it for a wider audience over my winter break. GUI improvements are soon to come, too.
   

### Find a Boiler (Java)
Tasked with developing a social media web app for my final project in Spring 2021, "Find a Boiler" came to fruition. Built alongside four others, we created a concurrent app that incorporates Java networking and Swing GUIs.

### Future Project Ideas
* Fantasy football app for my friends and me to use every NFL season
